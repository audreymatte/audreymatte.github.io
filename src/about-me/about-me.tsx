                                Always fascinated by the world of 3D, I learned by myself at the age of 13 some concepts
                                in 3D, such as modeling, animation and creating simple video games. I continued to learn
                                through the years and to do more 3D projects. Currently studying at Université Laval in
                                Baccalauréat en art et science de l’animation, I am improving my skills in this field
                                every day. I am passionate about what I do, and I hope you will see it through my
                                portfolio.
