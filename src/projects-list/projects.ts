      "Here is my end-of-term project for my first session at the university. The goal of the project was to create a still life scene from reference images. For my scene, I decided to do still life with a theme of french snack and add a touch of picnic with a little square fabric. For my lights, I wanted to create the cozy atmosphere of chic restaurants.The modeling was done with Maya and ZBrush and the textures with Substance Painter and Arnold.",
